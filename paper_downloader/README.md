This program will help you download the papers automatically and in batch, only needing you put the titles in the file `papers_to_be_downloaded.txt` and then execute main.py, with each title on the single line, , based on Google search. This program is not about hacking database but scanning the result of Google search returns.

ResearchGate also provides a lot of public papers, but the response of the http request containing js script, which is encrypted with hash value, to download papers from this source I have to decrypt the jS code, I read the code carelessly and found it is not difficult to decrypt, but for the time being, I do not have much spare time to do this, I am just gonna leave it to the moment when I am free because this program can download most the papers easily.
